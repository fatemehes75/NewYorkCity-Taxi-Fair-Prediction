# NewYorkCity-Taxi-Fair-Prediction

## Project goal:  

The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) is planning to develop an app that enables TLC riders to estimate the taxi fares in advance of their ride.

As a data professional, I want to help users (TLC riders) estimate their taxi fares before their ride. I plan to use the PACE strategy document to record decisions and reflections as I work through this end-of-course project!
